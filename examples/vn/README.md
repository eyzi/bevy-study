# VN

VN implementation

## Usage
```
cargo run --example vn
```

## Features
- Text animation
- Sprite change
- BG change
- Speaker and line change
- Dynamic script parsing
- Complete animating line on interaction

## Flaws
- I setup a folder to separate the VN plugin but I end up not using it.
Plan on doing it next time but not for now. All logic are in the scene
module. Features can be improved further but satisfactory for an
initial VN plugin.
- No sprite and BG animation
- No audio work
